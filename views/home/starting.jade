      ### For Groups

      Inter<span class=intertwinkles>Twinkles</span> is designed from the
      ground up to work for small groups (generally 20 or fewer people) who
      already know each other, and already use (or want to use) horizontal
      democratic decision making.

      ### Structured Communication

      You probably already have a way to talk to your group online &ndash; like
      a mailing list or forum. **InterTwinkles doesn't try to replace that**.
      InterTwinkles is a set of targeted tools that work well for *specific
      tasks* such as brainstorming ([dotstorm](/dotstorm/)), go-arounds
      ([firestarter](/firestarter/)), proposals ([resolve](/resolve/)), and
      shared document editing ([etherpad](/twinklepad/)).  Start your conversation
      in person or on a mailing list, then come here when you need to accomplish
      a specific task. Think of it as "Doodle for Deliberation".

      ### Flexible access control
      
      InterTwinkles lets you make anything your group works on private, public,
      or somewhere in between.  At a meeting and need to open a document so
      everyone can work on it without signing in?  No problem.  Want to lock it
      down afterwards?  Easy.

      Once a document is associated with your group, it's easy to [search](/search/)
      across all your brainstorms, proposals, go-arounds, or documents.
